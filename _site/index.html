          <p>I have been with Cardano since September 2017 silently in the background and actively engaging on the Cardano Forums and Reddit. But what makes me a prime candidate for SPOCRA? A SPOs job is to ensure we provide a robust ecosystem for the future of Cardano. That takes a deep understanding of Cardano, commitment, and time. From reading Cardano whitepapers too answering forum and reddit questions to educating and supporting the Cardano Ecosystem for the past 3 years, I have an understanding. While many out there don’t know me, I tend to be in the background reading and understanding how the community feels as a whole. If I was voted on the board, I would ensure every voice is heard and all SOCRA’s decisions are recorded and transparent.</p>

          <h4 class="resume-item-details">Cybersecurity</h4>
          <p class="resume-item-copy">I have over 7 years of hacking into networks, performing vulnerability and penetration test. I have a deep and technical understanding how networks should be secure, designed, and available. For the past 2 years, I have been designing, securing, and migrating existing systems into the cloud. My job during my previous 4-5 years, was a penetration tester, exploit writer and security engineer. Wouldn’t you want someone that understands security on the board?</p>

          <h4 class="resume-item-details">Dedication</h4>
          <p class="resume-item-copy">I believe in Cardano and a need for a unified SPO foundation. And I will ensure with all my might that SPOCRA becomes a professional, transparent, and successful foundation that strengthens the Cardano Ecosystem and a unified voice from all SPOs.</p>

          <h4 class="resume-item-details">Time</h4>
          <p class="resume-item-copy">Being a board member takes dedication, commitment, and time. I am fortunate enough to work remote and can spend several hours a day making SPOCRA a named for itself and making its mission come to life.</p>

        <div class="resume-item">
          <h4 class="resume-item-details">Transparent</h4>
          <p class="resume-item-copy">SPOCRA will be transparent. Decisions, communication, and actions, will have proper and clear workflows to ensure communication between SPCORA and the rest of the SPOs voices are heard, considered, and taken into consideration. I will ensure SPOCRA have these workflows in place to ensure the smallest SPO to the biggest SPO is heard.</p>
