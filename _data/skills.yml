# Who am I?
# Network Security
- skill: Cybersecurity
  description: I have over 7 years experience hacking into networks, as well as performing vulnerability and penetration tests. I have a deep and technical understanding how networks should be secured, designed, and available. For the past 2 years, I have been designing, securing, and migrating existing systems into the cloud. My job during my previous 4-5 years, was a penetration tester, exploit writer, and security engineer. Wouldnâ€™t you want someone that understands security on the board?
# Dedication
- skill: Dedication 
  description: I believe in Cardano and a need for a unified SPO foundation. And I will ensure with all my might that SPOCRA becomes a professional, transparent, and successful foundation that strengthens the Cardano Ecosystem with a unified voice from all SPOs.

# Time
- skill: Time
  description: Being a board member takes dedication, commitment, and time. I am fortunate enough to have the ability spend several hours a day making SPOCRA a name for itself and making its mission come to life.

# Transparent
- skill: Transparent
  description: SPOCRA will be transparent. Decisions, communication, and actions should have proper and clear workflows to ensure cohesion between SPOCRA and the rest of the SPOs.  I will ensure SPOCRA has these workflows in place to enable the smallest to the largest SPO is heard.
