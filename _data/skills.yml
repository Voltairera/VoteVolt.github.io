# Who am I?
# Network Security
- skill: Cybersecurity
  description: I have over 7 years of hacking into networks, performing vulnerability and penetration test. I have a deep and technical understanding how networks should be secure, designed, and available. For the past 2 years, I have been designing, securing, and migrating existing systems into the cloud. My job during my previous 4-5 years, was a penetration tester, exploit writer and security engineer. Wouldnâ€™t you want someone that understands security on the board?
# Dedication
- skill: Dedication 
  description: I believe in Cardano and a need for a unified SPO foundation. And I will ensure with all my might that SPOCRA becomes a professional, transparent, and successful foundation that strengthens the Cardano Ecosystem and a unified voice from all SPOs. 

# Time
- skill: Time
  description: Being a board member takes dedication, commitment, and time. I am fortunate enough to work remote and can spend several hours a day making SPOCRA a named for itself and making its mission come to life.

# Transparent
- skill: Transparent
  description: SPOCRA will be transparent. Decisions, communication, and actions, will have proper and clear workflows to ensure communication between SPCORA and the rest of the SPOs voices are heard, considered, and taken into consideration. I will ensure SPOCRA have these workflows in place to ensure the smallest SPO to the biggest SPO is heard.
